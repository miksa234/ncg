    Noncommutative geometry is a branch of mathematics that has deep
    connections to applications in physics. From reconstructing the
    theory of electrodynamics with minimal coupling to gravity, to deriving
    the full Lagrangian of the standard model and predicting the Higgs mass.
    One of the reasons for this is the natural existence of a nontrivial
    gauge group of a mathematical structure called the spectral triple, which
    encodes (classical) geometrical data intro algebraic data. Altogether
    this thesis is based on literature work, mostly from Walter D. Suijlekom's
    book \cite{ncgwalter}. We summarize enough information to both establish
    the basic backbone of noncommutative geometry and to further out derive
    the Lagrangian of electrodynamics.
