\subsection{Noncommutative Geometry of Electrodynamics}
\subsubsection{The Two-Point Space}
One of the basics forms of noncommutative space is the Two-Point space $X
:= \{x, y\}$. The Two-Point space can be represented by the following spectral triple
\begin{align}
    F_X := (C(X) = \mathbb{C}^2, H_F, D_F; J_F, \gamma _f).
\end{align}
Three properties of $F_X$ stand out. First of all the action of
$C(X)$ on $H_F$ is faithful for $dim(H_F) \geq 2$, thus we can make a simple
choice for the Hilbertspace, $H_F = \mathbb{C}^2$. Furthermore $\gamma_F$ is
the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ grading, which allows us to decompose $H_F$ into
\begin{align}
   H_F = H_F^+ \otimes H_F^- = \mathbb{C} \otimes \mathbb{C},
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
    H_F^\pm = \{\psi \in H_F |\; \gamma_F\psi = \pm \psi\},
\end{align}
are two eigenspaces. And lastly the Dirac operator $D_F$ lets us
interchange between $H_F^\pm$,
\begin{align}
    D_F =
        \begin{pmatrix}0 & t \\ \bar{t} & 0\end{pmatrix},  \;\;\;\;\;
            \text{with} \;\; t\in\mathbb{C}.
\end{align}

    The Two-Point space $F_X$ can only have a real structure if the Dirac
    operator vanishes, i.e. $D_F = 0$. In that case we have KO-dimension of 0,
    2 or 6. To elaborate on this, we know that there are two diagram representations of
    $F_X$ at $\underbrace{\mathbb{C} \oplus \mathbb{C}}_{C(X)}$ on
    $\underbrace{\mathbb{C} \oplus\mathbb{C}}_{H_F}$, which are:
    \begin{figure}[h!] \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}[
        dot/.style = {draw, circle, inner sep=0.06cm},
        no/.style = {},
        ]
        \node[no](a) at (0,0) [label=left:$\textbf{1}^\circ$] {};
        \node[no](b) at (0, -1) [label=left:$\textbf{1}^\circ$] {};
        \node[no](c) at (1, 0.5) [label=above:$\textbf{1}$] {};
        \node[no](d) at (2, 0.5) [label=above:$\textbf{1}$] {};
        \node[dot](d0) at (2,0) [] {};
        \node[dot](d0) at (1,-1) [] {};

        \node[no](a1) at (6,0) [label=left:$\textbf{1}^\circ$] {};
        \node[no](b2) at (6, -1) [label=left:$\textbf{1}^\circ$] {};
        \node[no](c2) at (7, 0.5) [label=above:$\textbf{1}$] {};
        \node[no](d2) at (8, 0.5) [label=above:$\textbf{1}$] {};
        \node[dot](d0) at (7,0) [] {};
        \node[dot](d0) at (8,-1) [] {};
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{figure}\newline
If the Two-Point space $F_X$ would be a real spectral triple then $D_F$ can
only go vertically or horizontally. This would mean that $D_F$ vanishes.
As for the KO-dimension The diagram on the left has KO-dimension 2 and 6, the diagram on the
right 0 and 4. Yet KO-dimension 4 is ruled out because
$dim(H_F^\pm) = 1$ (see Lemma 3.8 Book), which ultimately means $J_F^2 = -1$ is
not allowed.
\subsubsection{The Product Space}
By Extending the Two-Point space with a four dimensional Riemannian spin
manifold, we get an almost commutative manifold $M\times F_X$, given by
\begin{align}
    M\times F_X = \big(C^\infty(M, \mathbb{C}^2), L^2(S)\otimes \mathbb{C}^2,
    D_M\otimes 1 ; J_M\otimes J_F, \gamma_M \otimes \gamma_F\big),
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
   C^\infty(M, \mathbb{C}^2) \simeq C^\infty(M) \oplus  C^\infty(M).
\end{align}
According to Gelfand duality the algebra $C^\infty(M, \mathbb{C}^2)$ of the
spectral triple corresponds to the space
\begin{align}
    N:= M\otimes X \simeq M\sqcup X.
\end{align}
Keep in mind that we still need to find an appropriate real structure on the
Riemannian spin manifold, $J_M$. Furthermore total Hilbertspace can be decomposed into $H = L^2(S) \oplus L^2(S)$, such that for
$\underbrace{a,b\in C^\infty(M)}_{(a, b) \in C^\infty(N)}$
and $\underbrace{\psi, \phi \in L^2(S)}_{(\psi, \phi) \in H}$ we have
\begin{align}
    (a, b)(\psi, \phi) = (a\psi, b\phi)
\end{align}
Along with the decomposition of the total Hilbertspace we can consider a
distance formula on $M\times F_X$ with
\begin{align}\label{eq:commutator inequality}
    d_{D_F}(x,y) = \sup\left\{  |a(x) - a(y)|:a\in A_F, ||[D_F, a]|| \leq
    1 \right\}.
\end{align}
To calculate the distance between two points on the Two-Point space $X= \{x,
y\}$, between $x$ and $y$, we consider an $a \in \mathbb{C}^2 = C(X)$, which is
specified by two complex numbers $a(x)$ and $a(y)$. Then we simplify the
commutator inequality in \ref{eq:commutator inequality}
\begin{align}
    &||[D_F , a]|| = ||(a(y) - a(x))\begin{pmatrix}0 &t\\\bar{t} &0
    \end{pmatrix}|| \leq 1,\\
    &\Leftrightarrow |a(y) - a(x)|\leq \frac{1}{|t|},
\end{align}
and the supremum gives us the distance
\begin{align}
    d_{D_F} (x,y) = \frac{1}{|t|}.
\end{align}
An interesting observation here is that, if the Riemannian spin manifold can be
represented by a real spectral triple then a real structure $J_M$ exists,
then it follows that $t=0$ and the distance becomes infinite. This is a
purely mathematical observation and has no physical meaning.

We can also construct a distance formula on $N$ (in reference to a point $p
\in M$) between two points on $N=M\times X$, $(p, x)$ and $(p,y)$. Then an $a
\in C^\infty(N)$ is determined by $a_x(p):=a(p, x)$ and $a_y(p):=a(p, y)$.
The distance between these two points is
\begin{align}
    d_{D_F\otimes 1}(n_1, n_2) =  \sup \left\{ |a(n_1) - a(n_2)|: a\in
    A, ||[D\otimes 1, a]||\right\}.
\end{align}
On the other hand if we consider $n_1 = (p,x)$ and $n_2 = (q, x)$
for $p,q \in M$ then
\begin{align}
    d_{D_M \otimes 1} (n_1, n_2) = |a_x(p) - a_x(q)| \;\;\;\text{for}\;\;
    a_x\in
    C^\infty(M) \;\; \text{with} \;\; ||[D\otimes 1, a_x]|| \leq 1
\end{align}
The distance formula turns to out to be the geodesic distance formula
\begin{align}
    d_{D_M\otimes1}(n_1, n_2) = d_g(p, q),
\end{align}
which is to be expected since we are only looking at the manifold.
However if $n_1 = (p, x)$ and $n_2 = (q, y)$ then the two conditions are
\begin{align}
    &||[D_M, a_x]|| \leq 1, \;\;\; \text{and}\\
    &||[D_M, a_y|| \leq 1.
\end{align}
These conditions have no restriction which results in the distance being
infinite! And $N = M\times X$ is given by two disjoint copies of M  which are
separated by infinite distance

The distance is only finite if $[D_F, a] < 1$. In this case the commutator
generates a scalar field and the finiteness of the distance is
related to the existence of scalar fields.

\subsubsection{$U(1)$ Gauge Group}
To get a insight into the physical properties of the almost commutative
manifold $M\times F_X$, that is to calculate the spectral action, we need to
determine the corresponding Gauge theory.
For this we set of with simple definitions and important propositions to
help us break down and search for the gauge group of the Two-Point $F_X$
space which we then extend to $M\times F_X$. We will only be diving
superficially into this chapter, for further reading we refer to
\cite{ncgwalter}.
\begin{definition}
Gauge Group of a real spectral triple is given by
\begin{align}
    \mathfrak{B}(A, H; J) := \{ U = uJuJ^{-1} | u\in U(A)\}
\end{align}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
    A *-automorphism of a *-algebra $A$ is a linear invertible
    map
    \begin{align}
        &\alpha:A \rightarrow A\;\;\; \text{with}\\
        \nonumber\\
        &\alpha(ab) = \alpha(a)\alpha(b)\\
        &\alpha(a)^* = \alpha(a^*)
    \end{align}
    The \textbf{Group of automorphisms of the *-Algebra $A$} is denoted by
    $(A)$.\newline
    The automorphism $\alpha$ is called \textbf{inner} if
    \begin{align}
        \alpha(a) = u a u^* \;\;\; \text{for} \;\; U(A)
    \end{align}
    where $U(A)$ is
    \begin{align}
        U(A) = \{ u\in A|\;\; uu^* = u^*u=1\} \;\;\;
        \text{(unitary)}
    \end{align}
\end{definition}
The Gauge group of $F_X$ is given by the quotient $U(A)/U(A_J)$.
We want a nontrivial Gauge group so we need to choose a $U(A_J) \neq
U(A)$ and $U((A_F)_{J_F}) \neq U(A_F)$.
We consider our Two-Point space $F_X$ to be equipped with a real structure,
which means the operator vanishes, and the spectral triple representation is
\begin{align}
    F_X := \left(\mathbb{C}^2,\mathbb{C}^2, D_F =\begin{pmatrix}
        0&0\\0&0\end{pmatrix}; J_f =\begin{pmatrix}
    0&C\\C&0\end{pmatrix},
            \gamma_F = \begin{pmatrix}1&0\\0&-1\end{pmatrix}\right).
\end{align}
Here $C$ is the complex conjugation, and $F_X$ is a real even finite
spectral triple (space) of KO-dimension 6.

\begin{proposition}
The Gauge group of the Two-Point space $\mathfrak{B}(F_X)$ is $U(1)$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Note that $U(A_F) = U(1) \times U(1)$. We need to show that $U(A_F) \cap
    U(A_F)_{J_F}) \simeq U(1)$, such that $\mathfrak{B}(F) \simeq U(1)$. So
    for an element $a \in \mathbb{C}^2$ to be in $(A_F)_{J_F}$, it has to
    satisfy $J_F a^* J_F = a$,
    \begin{align}
        J_F a^* J^{-1} =
        \begin{pmatrix}0&C\\C&0\end{pmatrix}
            \begin{pmatrix}\bar{a}_1&0\\0&\bar{a}_2\end{pmatrix}
        \begin{pmatrix}0&C\\C&0\end{pmatrix}
            =
            \begin{pmatrix}a_2&0\\0&a_1\end{pmatrix}.
    \end{align}
    This can only be the case if $a_1 = a_2$. So we have
    $(A_F)_{J_F} \simeq \mathbb{C}$, whose unitary elements
    from $U(1)$ are contained in the diagonal subgroup of
    $U(A_F)$.
\end{proof}

An arbitrary hermitian field $A_\mu = -ia\partial _\mu b$  is given by
two $U(1)$ Gauge fields $X_\mu^1, X_\mu^2 \in C^\infty(M, \mathbb{R})$.
However $A_\mu$ appears in combination $A_\mu - J_F A_\mu J_F^{-1}$:
\begin{align}
 A_\mu - J_F A_\mu J_F^{-1} =
    \begin{pmatrix}X_\mu^1&0\\0&X_\mu^2 \end{pmatrix}
        -
    \begin{pmatrix}X_\mu^2&0\\0&X_\mu^1 \end{pmatrix}
        =:
    \begin{pmatrix}Y_\mu&0\\0&-Y_\mu \end{pmatrix}
    = Y_\mu \otimes \gamma _F,
\end{align}
where $Y_\mu$ the $U(1)$ Gauge field is defined as
\begin{align}
    Y_\mu := X_\mu^1 - X_\mu^2 \in C^\infty(M, \mathbb{R}) = C^\infty(M,
    i\ u(1)).
\end{align}

\begin{proposition}
    The inner fluctuations of the almost-commutative manifold $M\times
    F_X$ are parameterized by a $U(1)$-gauge field $Y_\mu$ as
    \begin{align}
        D \mapsto D' = D + \gamma ^\mu Y_\mu \otimes \gamma_F
    \end{align}
    The action of the gauge group $\mathfrak{B}(M\times F_X) \simeq
    C^\infty (M, U(1))$ on $D'$ is implemented by
    \begin{align}
        Y_\mu \mapsto Y_\mu - i\ u\partial_\mu u^*; \;\;\;\;\; (u\in
        \mathfrak{B}(M\times F_X)).
    \end{align}
\end{proposition}


\subsection{Electrodynamics}
In this chapter we describe Electrodynamics with the almost commutative
manifold $M\times F_X$ and the abelian gauge group $U(1)$.
We arrive at a unified description of gravity and electrodynamics although in the classical level.

The almost commutative Manifold $M\times F_X$ describes a local gauge group
$U(1)$. The inner fluctuations of the Dirac operator relate to $Y_\mu$ the
gauge field of $U(1)$. According to the setup we ultimately arrive at two
serious problems.

First of all in the Two-Point space $F_X$, the operator $D_F$ must vanish for
us to have a real structure. However this implies that the electrons
are massless, which would be absurd.

The second problem arises when looking at the Euclidean action for a free
Dirac field
\begin{align}
    S = - \int i \bar{\psi}(\gamma ^\mu\partial _\mu - m) \psi d^4x,
\end{align}
where $\psi,\ \bar{\psi}$ must be considered as independent variables, which
means that the fermionic action $S_f$ needs two independent Dirac spinors.
Let us try and construct two independent Dirac spinors with our data. To do
this we take a look at the decomposition of the basis and of the total
Hilbertspace $H = L^2(S) \otimes H_F$. For the orthonormal basis of $H_F$ we
can write $\{e, \bar{e}\}$ , where $\{e\}$ is the orthonormal basis of
$H_F^+$ and $\{\bar{e}\}$ the orthonormal basis of $H_F^-$. Accompanied with
the real structure we arrive at the following relations
\begin{align}
    J_F e &= \bar{e} \;\;\;\;\;\; J_F \bar{e} = e, \\
    \gamma_F e &= e  \;\;\;\;\;\;   \gamma_F \bar{e} = \bar{e}.
\end{align}
Along with the decomposition of $L^2(S) = L^2(S)^+ \oplus L^2(S)^-$ and  $\gamma = \gamma _M
\otimes \gamma _F$ we can obtain the positive eigenspace
\begin{align}
    H^+ = L^2(S)^+ \otimes H_F^+ \oplus L^(S)^- \otimes H_F^-.
\end{align}
So, for a $\xi \in H^+$ we can write
\begin{align}
    \xi = \psi _L \otimes e + \psi _R \otimes \bar{e}
\end{align}
where $\psi_L \in L^2(S)^+$ and $\psi _R \in L^2(S)^-$ are the two Wheyl
spinors. We denote that $\xi$ is only determined by one Dirac spinor $\psi :=
\psi_L + \psi _R$, \textbf{but we require two independent spinors}. Our
conclusion is that the definition of the fermionic action gives too much
restrictions to the Two-Point space $F_X$.
\subsubsection{The Finite Space}
To solve the two problems we simply enlarge (double) the Hilbertspace. This
is visualized by introducing multiplicities in Krajewski Diagrams which will also
allow us to choose a nonzero Dirac operator that will connect the two
vertices and preserve real structure making our particles massive and
bringing anti-particles into the mix.

We start of with the same algebra $C^\infty(M, \mathbb{C}^2)$, corresponding
to space $N= M\times X$. The Hilbertspace describes four particles, meaning
it has four orthonormal basis elements. It describes \textbf{left handed
electrons} and \textbf{right handed positrons}. Pointing this out, we have
$\{ \underbrace{e_R, e_L}_{\text{left-handed}}, \underbrace{\bar{e}_R,
\bar{e}_L}_{\text{right-handed}}\}$ the orthonormal basis for $H_F =
\mathbb{C}^4$. Accompanied with the real structure $J_F$, which allows us to
interchange particles with antiparticles by the following equations
\begin{align}
    &J_F e_R = \bar{e}_R, \\
    &J_F e_L = \bar{e_L}, \\
    \nonumber \\
    &\gamma _F e_R = -e_R,\\
    &\gamma_F e_L = e_L \\
\end{align}
where $J_F$ and $gamma_F$ have to following properties
\begin{align}
    &J_F^2 = 1,\\
    & J_F \gamma_F  = - \gamma_F J_F.
\end{align}
By means of $\gamma_F$ we have two options to decompose the total
Hilbertspace $H$, firstly into
\begin{align}
    H_F = \underbrace{H_F^+}_{\text{ONB } \{e_L, \bar{e}_L\}}
    \oplus \underbrace{H_F^-}_{\text{ONB } \{e_R, \bar{e}_R\}},
\end{align}
or alternatively into the eigenspace of particles and their
antiparticles (electrons and positrons) which is preferred in literature and
which we will use going further
\begin{align}
    H_F = \underbrace{H_{e}}_{\text{ONB } \{e_L, e_R\}} \oplus
    \underbrace{H_{\bar{e}}}_{\text{ONB } \{\bar{e}_L, \bar{e}_R\}}.
\end{align}
Here ONB means orthonormal basis.

The action of $a \in A = \mathbb{C}^2$ on $H$ with respect to the ONB
$\{e_L, e_R, \bar{e}_L, \bar{e}_R\}$ is represented by
\begin{align}\label{eq:leftrightrepr}
    a =
    (a_1 , a_2 ) \mapsto
        \begin{pmatrix}
            a_1 &0 &0 &0\\
             0&a_1 &0 &0\\
            0 &0 &a_2 &0\\
            0 &0 &0 &a_2\\
        \end{pmatrix}
\end{align}
Do note that this action commutes wit the grading and that
$[a, b^\circ] = 0$ with $b:= J_F b^*J_F$ because both the left and the right
action is given by diagonal matrices by equation \ref{eq:leftrightrepr}. Note
that we are still left with $D_F = 0$ and the following spectral
triple
\begin{align}\label{eq:fedfail}
        \left( \mathbb{C}^2, \mathbb{C}^2, D_F=0; J_F =
        \begin{pmatrix}
            0 & C \\ C &0
        \end{pmatrix},
        \gamma _F =
        \begin{pmatrix}
            1 & 0 \\ 0 &-1
        \end{pmatrix}
        \right).
    \end{align}
It can be represented in the following Krajewski diagram,
with two nodes of multiplicity two
    \begin{figure}[H] \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}[
        dot/.style = {draw, circle, inner sep=0.06cm},
        bigdot/.style = {draw, circle, inner sep=0.09cm},
        no/.style = {},
        ]
        \node[no](a) at (0,0) [label=left:$\textbf{1}^\circ$] {};
        \node[no](b) at (0, -1) [label=left:$\textbf{1}^\circ$] {};
        \node[no](c) at (0.5, 0.5) [label=above:$\textbf{1}$] {};
        \node[no](d) at (1.5, 0.5) [label=above:$\textbf{1}$] {};
        \node[dot](d0) at (1.5,0) [] {};
        \node[dot](d0) at (0.5,-1) [] {};
        \node[bigdot](d0) at (1.5,0) [] {};
        \node[bigdot](d0) at (0.5,-1) [] {};
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{figure}
\subsubsection{A noncommutative Finite Dirac Operator}
To extend our spectral triple with a non-zero Operator, we need to take a
closer look at the Krajewski diagram above. Notice that edges only exist
between multiple vertices, meaning we can construct a Dirac operator mapping
between the two vertices. The operator can be represented by the following matrix
\begin{align}\label{eq:feddirac}
    D_F =
    \begin{pmatrix}
    0 & d & 0 & 0 \\
    \bar{d} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & \bar{d} \\
    0 & 0 & d & 0
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{align}
We can now define the finite space $F_{ED}$.
\begin{align}
    F_{ED} := (\mathbb{C}^2, \mathbb{C}^4, D_F; J_F, \gamma_F)
\end{align}
where $J_F$ and $\gamma_F$ are like in equation \ref{eq:fedfail} and $D_F$
from equation \ref{eq:feddirac}.

\subsubsection{The almost-commutative Manifold}
The almost commutative manifold $M\times F_{ED}$ has KO-dimension 2, and is
represented by the following spectral triple
\begin{align}\label{eq:almost commutative manifold}
    M\times F_{ED} := \big(C^\infty(M,\mathbb{C}^2),\ L^2(S)\otimes
    \mathbb{C}^4,\
    D_M\otimes 1 +\gamma _M \otimes D_F;\; J_M\otimes J_F,\ \gamma_M\otimes
    \gamma _F\big)
\end{align}
The algebra didn't change, thus we can decompose it like before
\begin{align}
    C^\infty(M, \mathbb{C}^2) = C^\infty (M) \oplus C^\infty (M)
\end{align}
As for the Hilbertspace, we can decomposition it in the following way
\begin{align}
    H = (L^2(S) \otimes H_e ) \oplus (L^2(S) \otimes H_{\bar{e}}).
\end{align}
Note that the one component of the algebra is acting on $L^2(S) \otimes H_e$,
and the other one acting on $L^2(S) \otimes H_{\bar{e}}$. In other words the components of
the decomposition of both the algebra and the Hilbertspace match by the action of
the algebra.

The derivation of the gauge theory is the same for $F_{ED}$ as for the
Two-Point space $F_X$. We have $\mathfrak{B}(F) \simeq U(1)$ and for an
arbitrary gauge field $B_\mu = A_\mu - J_F A_\mu J_F^{-1}$ we can write
\begin{align} \label{field}
    B_\mu =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        Y_\mu & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & Y_\mu& 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & Y_\mu& 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & Y_\mu
    \end{pmatrix} \;\;\;\;\;\ \text{for} \;\;\ Y_\mu (x) \in \mathbb{R}.
\end{align}
We have one single $U(1)$ gauge field $Y_\mu$, carrying the action of the
gauge group
\begin{align}
   \text{$\mathfrak{B}$}(M\times F_{ED}) \simeq C^\infty(M, U(1))
\end{align}

The space $N = M\times X$ consists of two copies of $M$.
If $D_F = 0$ we have infinite distance between the two copies. Now have
hacked the spectral triple to have nonzero Dirac operator $D_F$. The new
Dirac operator still has a commuting relation with the algebra $[D_F, a] = 0$
$\forall a \in A$, and we should note that the distance between the two
copies of $M$ is still infinite. This is purely an mathematically abstract
observation and doesn't affect physical results.

\subsubsection{The Spectral Action}
In this chapter we bring all our results together to establish an
Action functional to describe a physical system. It turns out that
the Lagrangian of the almost commutative manifold $M\times F_{ED}$
corresponds to the Lagrangian of Electrodynamics on a curved
background manifold (+ gravitational Lagrangian), consisting of the spectral
action $S_b$ (bosonic) and of the fermionic action $S_f$.

The simplest spectral action of a spectral triple $(A, H, D)$ is given by the
trace of a function of $D$. We also consider inner fluctuations of the Dirac
operator $D_\omega = D + \omega + \varepsilon' J\omega J^{-1}$ where $\omega =
\omega ^* \in \Omega_D^1(A)$.
\begin{definition}
    Let $f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a suitable function
    \textbf{positive and even}. The spectral action is then
    \begin{align}
        S_b [\omega] := \text{Tr}\big(f(\frac{D_\omega}{\Lambda})\big)
    \end{align}
    where $\Lambda$ is a real cutoff parameter. The minimal condition on $f$
    is that $f(\frac{D_\omega}{\Lambda})$ is  a trace class operator. A trace
    class operator is a compact operator with a well defined finite trace
    independent of the basis. The subscript $b$ in $S_b$ stands for bosonic,
    because in physical applications $\omega$ will describe bosonic fields.

    In addition to the bosonic action $S_b$ we can define a topological spectral
    action $S_{top}$. Leaning on the grading $\gamma$ the topological spectral action is
    \begin{align}
        S_{\text{top}}[\omega] := \text{Tr}(\gamma\
        f(\frac{D_\omega}{\Lambda})).
    \end{align}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}\label{def:fermionic action}
    The fermionic action is defined by
    \begin{align}
        S_f[\omega, \psi] = (J\tilde{\psi}, D_\omega \tilde{\psi})
    \end{align}
    with $\tilde{\psi} \in H_{cl}^+ := \{\tilde{\psi}: \psi \in H^+\}$, where
    $H_{cl}^+$ is a set of Grassmann variables in $H$ in the +1-eigenspace
    of the grading $\gamma$.
\end{definition}

\textbf{APPENDIX??}
Grassmann variables are a set of Basis vectors of a vector space, they
form a unital algebra over a vector field $V$, where the generators are
anti commuting, that is for Grassmann variables $\theta _i, \theta _j$  we have
\begin{align}
    &\theta _i \theta _j = -\theta _j \theta _i \\
    &\theta _i x = x\theta _j \;\;\;\; x\in V \\
    &(\theta_i)^2 = 0 \;\;\; (\theta _i \theta _i = -\theta _i \theta _i)

\begin{proposition}
    The spectral action of the almost commutative manifold $M$ with $\dim(M)
    =4$ with a fluctuated Dirac operator is
    \begin{align}
        \text{Tr}(f\frac{D_\omega}{\Lambda}) \sim \int_M \mathcal{L}(g_{\mu\nu},
         B_\mu, \Phi) \sqrt{g}\ d^4x + O(\Lambda^{-1}),
    \end{align}
    where
    \begin{align}
        \mathcal{L}(g_{\mu\nu}, B_\mu, \Phi) =
        N\mathcal{L}_M(g_{\mu\nu})
        \mathcal{L}_B(B_\mu)+
        \mathcal{L}_\phi(g_{\mu\nu}, B_\mu, \Phi).
    \end{align}
    The Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}_M$ is of the spectral triple, represented by
    the following term
    $(C^\infty(M) , L^2(S), D_M)$
    \begin{align}\label{lagr}
        \mathcal{L}_M(g_{\mu\nu}) := \frac{f_4 \Lambda ^4}{2\pi^2} -
        \frac{f_2 \Lambda^2}{24\pi ^2}s - \frac{f(0)}{320\pi^2} C_{\mu\nu
        \varrho \sigma}C^{\mu\nu \varrho \sigma},
    \end{align}
    here $C^{\mu\nu \varrho \sigma}$ is defined in terms of the Riemannian
    curvature tensor $R_{\mu\nu \varrho \sigma}$ and the Ricci tensor
    $R_{\nu\sigma} = g^{\mu\varrho} R_{\mu\nu \varrho\sigma}$.
    The kinetic term of the gauge field is described by the Lagrangian
    $\mathcal{L}_B$, which takes the following shape
    \begin{align}
        \mathcal{L}_B(B_\mu) := \frac{f(0)}{24\pi^2}
        \text{Tr}(F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}).
    \end{align}
    Lastly $\mathcal{L}_\phi$ is the scalar-field Lagrangian with a boundary
    term, given by
    \begin{align}
        \mathcal{L}_\phi(g_{\mu\nu}, B_\mu, \Phi) :=
        &-\frac{2f_2\Lambda^2}{4\pi^2}\text{Tr}(\Phi^2) + \frac{f(0)}{8\pi^2}
        \text{Tr}(\Phi^4) + \frac{f(0)}{24\pi^2} \Delta(\text{Tr}(\Phi^2))\\
        &+ \frac{f(0)}{48\pi^2}s\text{Tr}(\Phi^2)
        \frac{f(0)}{8\pi^2}\text{Tr}((D_\mu \Phi)(D^\mu \Phi)).
    \end{align}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
     The dimension of the manifold $M$ is $\dim(M) = \text{Tr}(id) =4$. For
     an $x \in M$, we have an asymptotic expansion of the term
     $\text{Tr}(f(\frac{D_\omega}{\Lambda}))$ as $\Lambda$ goes to infinity,
     which can be written as
     \begin{align}\label{eq:trheatkernel}
         \text{Tr}(f(\frac{D_\omega}{\Lambda})) \simeq& \ 2f_4 \Lambda ^4
         a_0(D_\omega ^2)+ 2f_2\Lambda^2 a_2(D_\omega^2) \\&+ f(0) a_4(D_\omega^4)
         +O(\Lambda^{-1}).
     \end{align}
     We have to note here that the heat kernel coefficients are zero for uneven $k$,
     and they are dependent on the fluctuated Dirac operator
     $D_\omega$. We can rewrite the heat kernel coefficients in terms of $D_M$,
     for the first two terms $a_0$ and $a_2$ we use $N:=
     \text{Tr}\mathbbm{1_{H_F}})$ and write
     \begin{align}
         a_0(D_\omega^2) &= Na_0(D_M^2),\\
         a_2(D_\omega^2 &= Na_2(D_M^2) - \frac{1}{4\pi^2}\int_M.
         \text{Tr}(\Phi^2)\sqrt{g}d^4x
     \end{align}
     For $a_4$ we extend in terms of coefficients of $F$, \textbf{REWRITE: look week9.pdf
     for the standard version}
     \begin{align}
         &\frac{1}{360}\text{Tr}(60sF)= -\frac{1}{6}S(Ns + 4
         \text{Tr}(\Phi^2))\\
        \nonumber\\
         &F^2 = \frac{1}{16}s^2\otimes 1 + 1\otimes \Phi^4 - \frac{1}{4}
         \gamma^\mu\gamma^\nu \gamma^\varrho\gamma^\sigma F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}+\\
         &\;\;\;\;\;\;\;+\gamma^\mu\gamma^\nu\otimes(D_\mu\Phi)(D_\nu
         \Phi)+\frac{1}{2}s\otimes \Phi^2 + \ \text{traceless terms}\\
         \nonumber\\
         &\frac{1}{360}\text{Tr}(180F^2) = \frac{1}{8}s^2N + 2\text{Tr}(\Phi^4)
         + \text{Tr}(F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}) +\\
         &\;\;\;\;\;\;\;+2\text{Tr}((D_\mu\Phi)(D^\mu\Phi))
         + s\text{Tr}(\Phi^2)\\
         \nonumber\\
         &\frac{1}{360}\text{Tr}(-60\Delta F)=
         \frac{1}{6}\Delta(Ns+4\text{Tr}(\Phi^2)).
     \end{align}
     The cross terms of the trace in $\Omega_{\mu\nu}^E\Omega^{E\mu\nu}$
     vanishes because of the antisymmetric property of the Riemannian
     curvature tensor, thus we can write
     \begin{align}
         \Omega_{\mu\nu}^E\Omega^{E\mu\nu} = \Omega_{\mu\nu}^S\Omega^{S\mu\nu}
         \otimes 1 - 1\otimes F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} + 2i\Omega_{\mu\nu}^S
         \otimes F^{\mu\nu}.
     \end{align}
     The trace  of the cross term $\Omega^{S}_{\mu\nu}$ vanishes because
     \begin{align}
         \text{Tr}(\Omega^{S}_{\mu\nu}) = \frac{1}{4}
         R_{\mu\nu\varrho\sigma}\text{Tr}(\gamma^\mu\gamma^\nu) = \frac{1}{4}
         R_{\mu\nu\varrho\sigma}g^{\mu\nu} =0,
     \end{align}
     then the trace of the whole term is given by
     \begin{align}
         \frac{1}{360}\text{Tr}(30\Omega^E_{\mu\nu}\Omega^{E\mu\nu}) =
         \frac{N}{24}R_{\mu\nu\varrho\sigma}R^{\mu\nu\varrho\sigma}
         -\frac{1}{3}\text{Tr}(F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}).
     \end{align}
     Finally plugging the results into the coefficient $a_4$ and simplifying we get
     \begin{align}
         a_4(x, D_\omega^4) &= Na_4(x, D_M^2) + \frac{1}{4\pi^2}\bigg(\frac{1}{12} s
         \text{Tr}(\Phi^2) + \frac{1}{2}\text{Tr}(\Phi^4) \\
         &+ \frac{1}{4}
         \text{Tr}((D_\mu\Phi)(D^\mu \Phi)) + \frac{1}{6}
         \Delta\text{Tr}(\Phi^2) + \frac{1}{6}
         \text{Tr}(F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu})\bigg).
     \end{align}
     The only thing left is to substitute the heat kernel coefficients into the
     heat kernel expansion in equation \ref{eq:trheatkernel}.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Fermionic Action}
We remind ourselves the definition of the fermionic action in
\ref{def:fermionic action} and the manifold we are dealing with in equation
\ref{eq:almost commutative manifold}. The Hilbertspace $H_F$ is separated
into the particle-antiparticle states with ONB $\{e_R, e_L, \bar{e}_R,
\bar{e}_L\}$. The orthonormal basis of $H_F^+$ is $\{e_L, \bar{e}_R\}$ and
consequently for $H_F^-$, $\{e_R, \bar{e}_L\}$. We can decompose a spinor
$\psi \in L^2(S)$ in each of the eigenspaces $H_F^\pm$, $\psi = \psi_R+
\psi_L$. That means for an arbitrary $\psi \in H^+$ we can write
\begin{align}
    \psi = \chi_R \otimes e_R + \chi_L \otimes e_L + \psi_L \otimes
    \bar{e}_R+
    \psi_R \otimes \bar{e}_L,
\end{align}
where $\chi_L, \psi_L \in L^2(S)^+$ and $\chi_R, \psi_R \in L^2(S)^-$.

Since the fermionic action yields too much restriction on $F_{ED}$ (modified
Two-Point space $F_X$) we redefine it by taking account the fluctuated Dirac
operator
\begin{align}
    D_\omega = D_M \otimes i + \gamma^\mu \otimes B_\mu + \gamma_M \otimes
    D_F.
\end{align}
The Fermionic Action is
\begin{align}
S_F = (J\tilde{\xi}, D_\omega\tilde{\xi})
\end{align}
for a $\xi \in H^+$. Then the straight forward calculation gives \begin{align}
    \frac{1}{2}(J\tilde{\xi}, D_\omega\tilde{\xi})
        &=\frac{1}{2}(J\tilde{\xi}, (D_M \otimes
        i)\tilde{\xi})\label{eq:fermionic1}\\
        &+\frac{1}{2}(J\tilde{\xi}, (\gamma^\mu \otimes B_\mu)
        \tilde{\xi})\label{eq:fermionic2}\\
        &+\frac{1}{2}(J\tilde{\xi}, (\gamma_M\otimes
        D_F)\tilde{\xi})\label{eq:fermionic3},
\end{align}
(note that we add the constant $\frac{1}{2}$ to the action).
For the term in \ref{fermionic:1} we calculate
\begin{align}
    \frac{1}{2}(J\tilde{\xi}, (D_M\otimes 1)\tilde{\xi}) &=
    \frac{1}{2}(J_M\tilde{\chi}_R,D_M\tilde{\psi}_L)+
    \frac{1}{2}(J_M\tilde{\chi}_L,D_M\tilde{\psi}_R)+
    \\&+\frac{1}{2}(J_M\tilde{\psi}_L,D_M\tilde{\psi}_R)+
    \frac{1}{2}(J_M\tilde{\chi}_R,D_M\tilde{\chi}_L)\\
    &= (J_M\tilde{\chi},D_M\tilde{\chi}).
\end{align}
For the term in \ref{eq:fermionic2} we have
\begin{align}
    \frac{1}{2}(J\tilde{\xi}, (\gamma^\mu \otimes B_\mu)\tilde{\xi})&=
    -\frac{1}{2}(J_M\tilde{\chi}_R, \gamma^\mu Y_\mu\tilde{\psi}_R)
    -\frac{1}{2}(J_M\tilde{\chi}_L, \gamma^\mu Y_\mu\tilde{\psi}_R)+\\
    &+\frac{1}{2}(J_M\tilde{\psi}_L, \gamma^\mu Y_\mu\tilde{\chi}_R)+
    \frac{1}{2}(J_M\tilde{\psi}_R, \gamma^\mu Y_\mu\tilde{\chi}_L)=\\
    &= -(J_M\tilde{\chi}, \gamma^\mu Y_\mu\tilde{\psi}).
\end{align}
And for \ref{eq:fermionic3} we can write
\begin{align}
    \frac{1}{2}(J\tilde{\xi}, (\gamma_M\otimes D_F)\tilde{\xi})&=
    +\frac{1}{2}(J_M\tilde{\chi}_R, d\gamma_M\tilde{\chi}_R)
    +\frac{1}{2}(J_M\tilde{\chi}_L, \bar{d}\gamma_M\tilde{\chi}_L)+\\
    &+\frac{1}{2}(J_M\tilde{\chi}_L, \bar{d}\gamma_M\tilde{\chi}_L)
    +\frac{1}{2}(J_M\tilde{\chi}_R, d\gamma_M\tilde{\chi}_R)=\\
    &= i(J_M\tilde{\chi}, m\tilde{\psi}).
\end{align}
A small problem arises, we obtain a complex mass parameter $d$, but we can
write $d:=im$ for $m\in \mathbb{R}$, which stands for the real mass.

Finally the fermionic action of $M\times F_{ED}$ takes the form
    \begin{align}
        S_f = -i\big(J_M\tilde{\chi}, \gamma(\nabla^S_\mu - i\Gamma_\mu)
        \tilde{\Psi}\big) + \big(S_M\tilde{\chi}_L, \bar{d}\tilde{\psi}_L\big) -
        \big(J_M\tilde{\chi}_R, d \tilde{\psi}_R\big).
    \end{align}
Ultimately we arrive at the full Lagrangian of $M\times F_{ED}$, which is the
sum of purely gravitational Lagrangian
    \begin{align}
        \mathcal{L}_{grav}(g_{\mu\nu})=4\mathcal{L}_M(g_{\mu\nu})+
        \mathcal{L}_\phi (g_{\mu\nu}),
    \end{align}
and the Lagrangian of electrodynamics
    \begin{align}
        \mathcal{L}_{ED} = -i\bigg\langle
        J_M\tilde{\chi},\big(\gamma^\mu(\nabla^S_\mu - iY_\mu) -m\big)\tilde{\psi})
        \bigg\rangle
        +\frac{f(0)}{6\pi^2} Y_{\mu\nu}Y^{\mu\nu}.
    \end{align}
