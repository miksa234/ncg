\section{Acknowledgment}
First and foremost, I thank my supervisor Lisa Glaser for introducing me to
this rich field of study, where I had the chance to learn from a broad variety of
different mathematical and physical topics accompanied with great reflection sessions with
my supervisor every week. I thank my fellow students for the great time,
for the learning groups in preparation for exams and for on topic discussions
during my studies. And lastly I thank my friends and family for their continuous
love and support, for healthy breaks, and for discussions in different topics
outside of physics.
